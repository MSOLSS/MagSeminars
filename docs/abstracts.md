*Shear Alfvén Waves Driven by Magnetic Reconnection as an Energy Source for the Aurora Borealis*

Previous studies have concluded that the Hall magnetic field structures generated during
magnetic reconnection are carried away by kinetic Alfvén waves. Here, we apply a kinetic simulation with an ion/electron mass ratio closer to its natural value and find that open boundary conditions and much reduced damping rates permit the shear Alfvén waves (SAWs) to become the main carrier of wave energy. For magnetotail reconnection, these SAWs provide efficient transport of wave energy, enhancing the energy input for the Aurora Borealis by orders of magnitude above previous estimates.

*Modeling the Effects of Drift Orbit Bifurcation on Radiation Belt Electrons* 

Recently a mechanism called Drift Orbit Bifurcation (DOB) has been suggested to play a major role in the loss and transport of radiation belt electrons. The traditional DOB of radiation belt electrons happens when the dayside magnetosphere is compressed by the solar wind, and the magnetic field profile changes from the normal U shape (with a minimum at the equator) to a W shape (with two minima off equator). A particle used to bounce between two hemispheres could now be trapped on one side of the hemisphere, leading to a bifurcated drift shell. Since DOB violates the 2nd and 3rd adiabatic invariants of particles, it could lead to efficient pitch angle scattering and fast radial transport of radiation belt electrons. Therefore, it is critical to characterize the DOB effect and include it in radiation belt models. Results from our guiding-center test particle simulations using the Tsyganenko-1989c magnetic field model show that the particle transport induced by the traditional DOB is diffusive at small equatorial pitch angles and ballistic or advective at large equatorial pitch angles. DOB is shown to affect a broad region of outer radiation belt which could penetrate inside the geosynchronous orbit at Kp ≥ 3. And the effects are more significant further away from Earth, at higher Kp, and for higher electron energies. Moreover, our calculation of the radial diffusion rate (DLL) shows that the DLL due to DOB for the diffusive case could be comparable to the DLL due to electron interactions with ULF waves. Interestingly, our simulation results also reveal a nontraditional type of DOB caused by a third minimum of the magnetic field strength near equator on top of the traditional W-shaped magnetic field profile, which is reported here for the first time. The simulations show that this new type of DOB results in particle transport that is distinct from the traditional DOB, i.e., ballistic transport at small equatorial pitch angles and diffusive transport at large equatorial pitch angles. Both the effects of traditional and nontraditional DOB will be discussed in this talk. It is significant to demonstrate that DOB could cause effective loss and transport of radiation belt electrons even in the absence of waves.
