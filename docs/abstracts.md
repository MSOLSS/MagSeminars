*Neural Network Models of the Near-Earth Solar Wind and Magnetosheath*

The dayside of Earth’s magnetosphere is the site of many solar wind-magnetosphere interactions, including magnetic reconnection. Magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetopause locally converts magnetic energy into kinetic energy and broadly opens Earth's magnetosphere to the driving solar wind which fuels geomagnetic storms. It is common to use conditions in the solar wind upstream of the Earth as the input for models of the occurrence and strength of magnetic reconnection. However, the upstream solar wind is not the direct physical input into the system. The shocked plasma in the magnetosheath is what is directly interfacing with Earth’s magnetic field at the magnetopause, and is therefore intuitively the more relevant physical quantity for controlling magnetic reconnection. Magnetosheath conditions are rarely used as direct model inputs because the magnetosheath cannot currently be continuously sampled in the same way that the solar wind upstream of the Earth is continuously sampled (e.g. by spacecraft at L1); instead they are typically inferred from upstream solar wind conditions. There are potential sources of uncertainty that this process has: propagating solar wind conditions from L1 to the bow shock (as is done for OMNI) has issues close to the boundary between solar wind flow parcels and in other situations, and the bow shock’s processing of plasma depends strongly on the shock configuration. In order to remedy some of these issues, two neural networks are trained to predict MMS measurements in the magnetosheath and solar wind from time series Wind input. The network trained to produce solar wind data predicts measurements of the solar wind more accurately than MVA-propagated solar wind data in the OMNI database. The network trained to produce magnetosheath data predicts measurements of the magnetosheath more accurately than magnetic field draping codes applied to OMNI data. The outputs of both models correlate more strongly with geomagnetic indices than OMNI data or draped OMNI data, with output from the magnetosheath model more strongly correlating with all indices than output from the solar wind model. These models could prove to be operationally useful for studies of energy transfer into the magnetosphere via magnetic reconnection.

*Statistical Study of Foreshock Density Holes* 

Density holes (DHs), characterized by the correlating depletion of plasma density and magnetic field strength, are one of the transient structures frequently observed upstream of Earth’s bow shock. The low dynamic pressure of DHs may disturb the bow shock and magnetopause, and have potential geoeffects. In this paper, we perform a statistical study of 411 density hole events, identified by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) Mission. The average occurrence rate of DHs is ~5.4 events/day. All DHs are associated with foreshock ions. DHs tend to occur on the dawn side than on the dusk side. The occurrence rate is higher when there is faster solar wind, larger magnetic shear angle across DHs, and lower magnetic field strength. The spatial scale of DHs is several RE. Within DHs, electron heating and density depletion are correlated. Most DHs do not have significant flow deflections. Most DHs with discontinuities have the convection electric field pointing towards the discontinuity on at least one side. About two thirds of the 411 events show different characteristics compared to other types of foreshock transients that also have correlated density and field strength depletion.
