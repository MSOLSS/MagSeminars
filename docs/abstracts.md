*Earth's Magnetosphere Interaction with Solar Wind Periodic Density Structures: ULF Waves and Radiation Belt Response*

In the solar wind density, we often observe periodic fluctuations on time scales ranging from a few minutes to a few hours which we refer to as Periodic Density Structures (PDSs). The PDSs belong to the class of "meso-scale structures" with radial length scales greater than or equal to the size of the Earth's dayside magnetosphere. The periodic character of these transients (≈0.2-4.0 mHz) can determine periodic compressional fluctuations of the Earth's magnetic field at similar frequencies. These time scales overlap with the frequency range of Pc5 Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) waves (≈1.7-6.7 mHz).  Magnetic field compressional fluctuations at these time scales have important consequences on the Earth’s magnetosphere system, for example coupling with Field Line Resonances, affecting the dynamics and loss of radiation belt electrons. Using a recent spectral analysis approach, developed to robustly identify fluctuations at discrete frequencies in the solar wind and magnetosphere observations, we were able to differentiate directly driven oscillations and Pc5 ULF waves. We identified clear examples of such a directly driven process showing also effects on radiation belt electron dynamics and loss.

*Quantifying the size and duration of a microburst-producing chorus region on 5 December 2017* 

Microbursts are impulsive (<1s) injections of electrons (few keV to >MeV) from the outer radiation belt into the atmosphere, primarily caused by nonlinear scattering by chorus waves. Although attempts have been made to quantify their contribution to outer belt electron loss, the uncertainty in the overall size and duration of the microburst region is typically large, so that their contribution to outer belt loss is uncertain. We combine datasets that measure chorus waves (Van Allen Probes (RBSP), Arase, ground-based VLF stations) and microburst (>30 keV) precipitation (FIREBIRD II and AC6 CubeSats, POES/MetOp) to determine the size of the microburst-producing chorus source region beginning on 5 December 2017. We show that the lower/upper limits on the long-lasting (~30 hours) microburst precipitation region is 4 to 8 ∆MLT and 2 to 8.5 ∆L. We conclude that microbursts likely represent a major loss source of outer radiation belt electrons for this event.
