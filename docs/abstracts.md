*Refining predictions of reconnection X-lines at Earth's Magnetopause*

Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental plasma process of key importance to several fields. Reconnection at Earth’s magnetopause drives magnetospheric convection and provides mass and energy input into the magnetosphere/ionosphere system.
Despite this importance, the factors governing the location of dayside magnetopause reconnection are not well understood.

Though a few models can predict X-line locations reasonably well the underlying physics is still unresolved. In this study we present results from an intensive analysis of over 100 reconnection regions observed by MMS to determine what quantities are most strongly associated with the occurrence of dayside magnetopause reconnection. We also attempt to answer under what upstream conditions are global X-line models least reliable.

*Radiation Belt Electron Acceleration Driven by Very-Low-Frequency Transmitter Waves in Near-Earth Space* 

Very-Low-Frequency (VLF) transmitters operate worldwide typically at frequencies of 10–30 kilohertz and are well known to drive important electron precipitation in the near-Earth space environment. However, the capability of VLF transmitters to accelerate electrons has mostly been overlooked and assumed to be negligible. By performing two-dimensional Fokker-Planck diffusion simulations, we quantify the role of VLF transmitters and other naturally occurring plasma waves in electron acceleration in the inner belt and slot region. We find that VLF transmitter waves can simultaneously accelerate higher energy electrons and drive electron loss at lower energies. However, the net acceleration is typically suppressed by stronger pitch-angle diffusion due to lightning-generated whistlers and plasmaspheric hiss. Due to the now-achievable rocket exhaust driven amplification (REDA) of VLF waves suggested by recent studies, control of wave-induced acceleration can be actively tested with various VLF wave intensities in space. With amplification by a factor of 5, the acceleration by VLF transmitters can overcome the losses by lightning-generated whistlers and plasmaspheric hiss, leading to net acceleration in the combined scattering. The acceleration occurs within 1 minute with amplification factor of 50 dB, which is believed to be achievable in the future REDA experiment, representing a feasible test of the theory.
