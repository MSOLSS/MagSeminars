Following the retirement of the community-supported Van Allen Probes mission, the quest for high-quality energetic particle measurements in the radiation belts is likely to be taken on by smaller spacecraft like CubeSats in the foreseeable future. Here we introduce Relativistic Electron Proton Telescope integrated little experiment-2 (REPTile-2), a miniaturized (~1U) solid-state charged particle telescope that aims to undertake this challenging task. It incorporates detailed pulse-height analysis to enable 60 electron channels and 60 proton channels and includes anticoincidence detectors to minimize unwanted background contamination. This paper presents a description of the REPTile-2 design and emphasizes the importance of extensive Geant4-based analysis to inform the design of a new energetic particle detector and characterize the instrument response. Our analysis shows that REPTile-2 can measure ~0.3- ~4 MeV electrons and ~6.7-35 MeV protons with energy resolution (âˆ†E/E) between 7-38% for electrons and 1.5-5% for protons. In addition, pulse pileup is modeled using theoretical equations and could be significant for electrons in the inner belt. Results from a Sr-90/Y-90 radioactive source test have verified the instrument performance and certified the validity of Geant4 simulations. These energetic particle measurements will enable a new scientific understanding of the inner radiation belt, where unwanted contamination from the unforgiving penetration of highly energetic protons (tens of MeV to GeV) is common and provide detailed quantification of the inner belt electrons and protons at the Low-Earth Orbit that is crucial for space weather modeling.

The polar cap potential, a measure of the magnetosphere's response to the solar wind electric field, levels off during high values of the field. Several explanations have been proposed for this saturation effect, but there has been no consensus. We show that the saturation may be merely a perception created by uncertainty in the solar wind measurements and its propagation to the polar cap. Correcting for this uncertainty reveals a true linear response across the full range of the solar wind electric field values. If true, these findings indicate that extreme space weather events elicit a larger impact on Earth than what we'd expect if the polar cap potential were to saturate.
