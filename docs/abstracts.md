*Three-dimensional reconstruction of ion fluxes in the Earth’s northern cusp using neural networks*

Magnetic reconnection on the dayside magnetopause represents the primary mechanism for transporting mass, momentum, and energy from the solar wind into the inner terrestrial magnetosphere.  This energy transfer ultimately drives geomagnetic activity such as storms and substorms within the Earth’s magnetosphere. Continuous investigation of magnetic reconnection is difficult with current space-based instruments as spacecraft orbits restrict data in situ observations to at most a few minutes. Several studies have demonstrated that the location and dynamics of dayside magnetic reconnection can be inferred remotely from the time-energy dispersion of ions in the Earth's cusps. However, individual spacecraft passes through the cusps last only a few minutes. To overcome this problem, we generate a machine-learning-based model of the Earth's northern cusp using Cluster mission observations from 2001 to 2009 to reconstruct time-dependent, three-dimensional ion flux distributions. We implement a regression model using an artificial neural network (ANN) and several geomagnetic indexes and solar wind parameters as inputs, as well as ion flux acquired by the CIS/CODIF instrument onboard the Cluster mission as supervised outputs. Preliminary results show a high correlation between instrument observations and model outputs as a function of solar wind conditions. We demonstrate how this data-based model can be used to conduct comprehensive studies of the cusp and reconnection on the dayside magnetosphere for time-varying solar wind conditions.

*Investigating Radiation Belt Precipitation from Low Earth Orbit: Cross-Calibration of REACH and POES Observations* 

Radiation belt electron precipitation is typically caused by a variety of wave-particle interactions (e.g., chorus, hiss, etc..). From a magnetospheric point of view, the timescales of electron precipitation, or the electron lifetime, informs us of the dominant physical process scattering electrons into the bounce loss cone. From an ionospheric/upper atmospheric point of view, electrons with energies greater than ~200 keV deposit their energy below the D-region ionosphere. This changes the chemical and electrical properties of the neutral atmosphere and contributes to ozone destruction through production of HOx and NOx. We are working toward creating global maps of the precipitating electron energy spectrum by cross-calibrating REACH and POES data. A global map of precipitating electron flux from LEO will allow us to estimate electron lifetimes while isolating the physical process that has caused the electrons to precipitate (wave-particle interactions). Furthermore, electron sources and losses to space will not be considered in these estimates. The precipitating electron flux will also be used to calculate global ionization altitude profiles with excellent spatial resolution.
