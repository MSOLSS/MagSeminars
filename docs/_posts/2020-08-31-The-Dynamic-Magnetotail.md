Dr. Joachim Birn continued our discussion of the night side magnetosphere and followed up Christines overview of magnetospheric covection and substorms with a discussion of tail dynamics, substorms, and the near Earth nutral line (NENL) model from a theory and simulation point of view. Joachim started with a dive into the history of the dynamic magnetotail including; the formation of a thin current sheet; the nominal, but at the time unmamed phases of a substorm; the formation of the substorm current wedge; and the signatures of dipolarizations and substorm injections. He then moved to more mordern results focusing on simulations showing the formation of the thin current sheet during the substorm growth phase, the onset and evolution of reconnection in particle in cell simulations and an overview of the substorm expansion phase in global MHD models including the formation of the substorm current wedge and bursty bulk flow/flow bursts in the tail. Joachim finished his seminar with an overview  of particle acceleration in dipolarization fronts during the substorm growth phase and a discussion of open questions and future work.
