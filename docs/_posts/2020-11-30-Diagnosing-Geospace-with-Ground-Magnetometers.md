The volume encompassed by the Earth's magnetosphere is large and sparsely populated by in-situ observations making it, at times, difficult to characterize the macro, meso, and global scale dyanmics of the system. In this weeks talk Dr. Ian Mann discussed the utility of ground-based magnetometer arrays to supplement to characterize geospace dyanmics and complement in-situ observations. The magnetosphere and ionosphere are coupled together via magnetic field lines which support both field-aligned currens as well as waves. These current systems and waves can be observed on the ground using both fluxgate and search coil magnetometers, and with careful mapping of magnetic field lines, these observations can be used to diagnose and quantify magnetospheric activity. In his talk Ian focussed on four research topics, energy input into the magnetospheric system, characterizing magnetospheric substorms, storm-time magnetosphere dynamics, and magneto-seismology. Solar wind energy can couple to the magnetosphere system via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and solar wind impulses; these processes generate ULF waves which in turn couple to Field Line Resonances (FLRs). Ian demonstrated how a latitudinal array of ground-based magnetometers can be used to diagnose and qauntify these FLRs and hence the transfer of energy from the solar wind to the magnetosphere system. He further highlighted  how this transfer of energy the corresponding waves waves may be able to drive large goemagnetically induced currents on the flanks which can also be characterized by ground-based magnetometers. Ian then discussed how a dense array of ground-based magnetometers may be used to characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics of impulsive ULF waves at substorms onset. With careful analysis ground-based magnetometers can determine the location and time of substorm expansion pahse onset in the ionosphere, which is colocated with auroral beads. Following substorms, Ian discussed the utility of ground-based magnetometers in the study of storm-time radiation belt dynamics and in particular the role of ULF waves in energetic electron enhancmenents, and the utility of ground-based magnetometers to quantify ULF wave radial diffusion coeffecients for use in radiation belt simulations. In finished his talk with a breif discussion of magneto-seismology, the cross-phase technique and diagnossing the spatio-temporal structure of the plasmasphere with ground-based magnetometers.
