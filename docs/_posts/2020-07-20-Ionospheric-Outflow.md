In todays seminar Dr. Bill Peterson gave an overview of ionospheric outflow titled "Ionospheric Outflow: Observations Constraints on Global Models". Bill started off by giving a graphical and descriptive view of "The Big Picture", that is, an overarching view of the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system. He then proceeded with a history of thermal and suprathermal ion observations including observations from Akebono, Polar, DE-1 and DMSP. He  discussed the "Gap Region", a region between ~1000-5000 km with limited observations and an overall lack of knowledge of the physical processes which may or may not be occurring and of outflow in general, followed this by an overview of ion acceleration and energization mechanisms, and recent model results and data-model comparisons. Bill finished his talk with a discussion of whether ions could be tracked through the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system with current multi-point observations, the importance of solar wind as a source for ions in the magnetosphere, and unanswered questions/future work.
