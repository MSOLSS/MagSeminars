Dr. Gina DiBraccio provides an extensive overview of Fluxgate magnetometers used in space missions and demonstrates the importance of magnetic field measurements in the solar system. She mainly focuses on ring core fluxgate magnetometers, which are commonly used for space exploration. After explaining its working principle, Dr. DiBraccio discusses the methods used to keep the spacecraft electronics from contaminating the magnetometer's measurements. Throughout her talk, she shows examples of different magnetometers used in interplanetary missions like Maven and Juno. She discusses calibration techniques and emphasizes in-flight calibration techniques necessary to keep the sensor from drifting. Finally, Dr. DiBraccio recounts several significant discoveries made throughout the solar system using magnetic field measurements. From Mercury to the edge of the solar system, space-borne magnetometers have revealed remnant magnetic fields locked into planetary crusts, challenged prevailing theories of planetary core dynamos, and identified the termination shock at the edge of the solar system.
