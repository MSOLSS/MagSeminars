Professor Yu Lin of Auburn University presented an introduction to global hybrid code modeling of the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction and then illustrated how hybrid code models can be used to address a broad range of research problems.  In particular, she described the ANGIE3D model, in which ions are treated kinetically whilst electrons are treated as a fluid.  The model spans the magnetosphere from 20 RE upstream to the magnetotail, with an inner boundary at 3 RE.  The grid size varies from from ~1 ion gyroradius near Earth to larger values at greater distances.  In this model resitivity is current driven.  Professor Lin used the model to show that reconnection-generated Kinetic Alfven waves are ubiquitous in the magnetotail, even in regions with dipole magnetic field configurattions.  They heat ions and generate anisotropic temperatures.  It is not easy to map them from the tail to the ionosphere because of phenomena that occur in the flow breaking region in the near-Earth magnetotail.  On the dayside, the model predicts the production of flux rope flux transfer events bounded by pairs of reconnection lines.  First one line forms and moves away from the equator and then a second lines forms nearer the equator.  The ropes move poleward away from equatorial regions.  The model predicts d-shaped plasma velocity distributions like those observed by spacecraft in magnetopause boundary layers.  The model predicts the formation of bubbles when rotational discontinuities enter the foreshock.  Large density enhancements on the edges of the bubbles propagate antisunward, resulting in magnetosheath pressure pulses applied to the magnetosphere.
