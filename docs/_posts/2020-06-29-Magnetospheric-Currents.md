Dr. Ramon Lopez surveyed and provided a brief history of the various current systems within the Earth's magnetosphere and coupled solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system. Ramon discussed the Chapman-Ferraro currents, the Region 0, 1, and 2 Birkelend currents and their generation mechanisms. He then discussed the cross-tail current system and the substorm current wedge. He finished with a discussion of the ring current, one of the oldest observed space physics phenomena, and the bow shock current system. Ramon concluded with a great final point "Much is known about these current systems but there are also plenty of unkowns, and probably some unknow unkowns".
