Dr. Weichao Tu comprehensively reviewed our current understanding of energetic particle precipitation.  She began by noting the relevance of this topic, which plays an important role in radiation belt loss, auroral physics, magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, and atmospheric chemistry.  She outlined step-by-step how particles can be lost to the atmosphere via wave-particle scattering, encounters with unusual magnetic field configurations, and variations in the loss cone size driven by ULF waves.  Next came a discussion of the observations from low-altitude spacecraft, balloons, and the ground that we use to determine precipitation intensities.  A discussion of 1-, 2-, and 4- dimensional modeling followed.  She concluded by addressing as yet unresolved questions concerning the extent of global precipitation and its significance to the radiation belts as a whole.
