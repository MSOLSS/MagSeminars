In this weekâ€™s seminar Dr. Adam Kellerman from UCLA discussed Data Assimilation and it's use in radiation belt physics. Adam began with a brief history of data assimilation beginning in 1904 with numerical weather prediction as a deterministic initial value problem and finding solutions to partial differential equations. Following World War II data assimilation rapidly advanced and quickly developed into a field of research unto itself. Adam went on to highlight two _types_ of data assimilation: forecasting, predicating future states; and reanalysis, using data assimilation to _correct_ simulation output which can help to identify missing physics within models. Following this Adam discussed different methods of data assimilation including direct insertion, nudging, and successive correction methods, as well as algorithms for computing fitting coefficients (least squares, the cost function, and Bayesian derivation) which underpin data assimilation. He then discussed how data assimilation is implemented highlighting two review papers which provide a more detailed discussion of data assimilation methods. Adam then discussed data assimilation in Space Physics highlighting 6 examples of data assimilation in radiation belt physics. Adam concluded his seminar with a discussion of where data assimilation in Space Physics needs to be in the future. Though this is a broad question, which is often case-specific, Adam highlighted that most cases can be built up from the same foundation. He discussed the importance of Application Usability Levels: A Framework for Tracking Project Product Progress, the need to shift from deterministic to probabilistic model outputs, and the importance of metrics, observer system experiments, observing system simulation experiments, and parameterizing processes not currently included in models. Adam then provided a brief overview of recent work helping to push data assimilation in space physics forward.
