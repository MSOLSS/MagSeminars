Dr. Jerry Goldstein give a detailed overview of plasmasphere and its "popularity" from its orignal discovery to present day. Jerry started his discussion with a general description of the plasmasphere comprised of a main torus of cold dense plasma with significant variation and structure including a dense O+ torus and plasmaspheric plume. He moved onto a discussion of the importance of the plasmasphere in magnetospheric physics and space weather dynamics highlighting that the plasmasphere carries the majority of mass and inertia in the magnetosphere, impacts spacecraft charging, and is a major controller of wave processes including the propagation of Alfven waves and the growth of waves which contribute to ring current and radiation belt losses. Jerry continued with a brief history of the discovery of the plasmasphere in the 1960's which was initially believed to be a pseudo-static structure that was "big" during quiet geomagnetic activity and "small" during large geomagnetic activity. Throughout the rest of his talk Jerry emphasized that the plasmasphere was indeed very dynamic, a view which was reinforced by the launch of IMAGE and the dawn of plasmasphere imaging. He highlighted dynamic processes such as the formation of the plasmasphere shoulder and periods of severe erosion, processes that depicted a clear and dynamic cycle of plasmasphere loss and refilling. He then discussed timing delays between day- and night-side erosion, model-data comparisons of the plasmasphere boundaries, and the effects of considering a structured plasmapause boundary in the dynamic evolution of the plasmasphere. Jerry finished his talk with a discussion of open questions and plasmaspheres at other planets.
