Dr. Ying Zou presented a comprehensive review of magnetopause physics divided into two parts: the structure of the magnetopause and its dynamics.  Within structure, she considered the location of the magnetopause, its thickness and motion and the current it carries.  Within dynamics, she addressed the signatures used to identify reconnection at the magnetopause, in the cusps, and in ground-based observations, then the time dependence, location, and extent of reconnection.  She concluded with a discussion of the evidence for the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the magnetopause.  A highlight of this presentation was the emphasis on topics needing more research; the upcoming joint [ESA/CAS SMILE][3] and [NASA TRACERS][4] missions will help to address these outstanding topics.
