In this weekâ€™s seminar Vania Jordanova discussed the Earth's ring current and provided detailed model-data comparisons of the dynamics and cross-coupling of the ring current with plasma populations and physical processes throughout the magnetosphere and ionosphere. Vania began with a brief discussion of multiple approaches to modelling the Earth's ring current and an overview of large-scale transport within the magnetosphere. From here she focussed on the RAM-SCB model framework and examples from and comparisons of RCM-SCB simulations with various datasets. In particular, Vania showed the effects of including a hi-resolution electric field, a self-consistent magnetic field, and the role of the induced electric field in simulations. She moved onto a discussion of ring current composition, sources of ring current ions (including the plasmasheet), and ring current loss processes such as charge exchange, coulomb collisions, and wave-particle interactions. Vania then discussed ring current coupling with subauroral proton arcs and radiation belt electrons showing data model comparisons with IMAGE-FUV, chorus wave distributions, energetic particle precipitation, and Van Allen electron flux observations. She finished her discussion new results investigating the role of field line curvature scattering in ring current losses. In her final slides Vania provided a detailed list of references, highlighted a new book ["Ring Current Investigations: The Quest for Space Weather"][3] and emphasized outstanding questions in ring current research.
