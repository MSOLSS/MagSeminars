In this seminar, Dr. Roman Gomez provides a detailed overview of Electrostatic Analyzers (ESAs) - a category of sensors used to measure charged particles based on their energy-to-charge ratio. They are useful in laboratories to measure ion beam energies and generating high precision ion beams themselves. In space physics, this instrument is a staple in satellite missions to measure particle fluxes and phase-space densities. 

Dr. Gomez starts by discussing ESA's general characteristics, their simple construction, and their function as an *ion-optical device*, a *band-pass filter,* and *an electrostatic prism* for charged particles. He then describes its use-cases in laboratories and space. After which, he dives into a deeper discussion of three types of ESAs: Top-Hat ESAs, Toroidal ESAs, and Cusp-ESAs. Compared to their flat-aperture counterparts, Top-Hat ESAs have a larger field of view while maintaining the same size, and the Toroidal ESAs allow for better coupling with simultaneous mass measurements. Finally, Dr. Gomez reminded us that ESA designs need to be optimized specifically to the mission based on the acceptable trade-offs between the energy range, time interval, and resolution of the detector.  He concluded the session by recommending the following literature that may help acquaint the reader more with the ESAs:
