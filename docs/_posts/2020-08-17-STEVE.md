Dr. Liz MacDonald gave a wonderful overview of STEVE ([formerly known as Steve][1]), the [Aurorasaurus program][2], and citizen science. Liz started her talk with a discussion on the importance and usefulness of Citizen Science which was fundamental in the discovery of STEVE, emphasizing how Citizen Science can be used to supplement not only scientific research but scientific instruments as well, and how, when properly leveraged, can generate high-quality data and research on a massive scale. Liz continued with a description of STEVE, a narrow east-west aligned auroral arc with a purple hue that is often associated with picket fence green-line aurora, and noted that though STEVE can be observed at all longitudes most observations of STEVE have been made in Alberta Canada the result of a dedicated group of amateur auroral photographers, the [Alberta Auroral Chasers][3], chasing [STEVE][4]. She continued with a detailed overview of observations of and recent advances in the study of STEVE including the association of STEVE with subauroral ion drifts (SAIDs), in-situ and multi-point observations of STEVE, recent statistical studies, why STEVE is purple, efforts to understand and triangulate the picket fence phenomena associated with STEVE and the general conditions under which STEVE forms. Liz also highlighted work from an amateur auroral historian who found evidence of STEVE dating back to the early 1900's. Liz concluded her seminar with open question regarding STEVE such as; what does STEVE look like in radar observations? What is the occurrence of STEVE during larger geomagnetic storms and what are the potential Space Weather impacts of STEVE?

You can find a recording of Liz's talk on our [YouTube channel][5] and a copy of Liz's talk [here][6]. Below you can also find a number of references from Liz's talk (provided by Laura, the Aurorasaurus project manager) as well as some suggested reading on Subauroral Ion Drifts by Stanislav Sazykin.
