In this weekâ€™s seminar Dr. Jim LaBelle discussed theory, observations, and physical mechanisms of Auroral waves and radiation. Auroral emissions are important in plasma physics as they link physically separate plasma regimes allowing energy to flow between two systems and the insights we gain at Earth, a _relatively_ local laboratory,  can be applied to planetary and astrophysical plasmas, most importantly, waves and the aurora are very cool. Jim began his seminar with a discussion of the "dispersion surface" and the various wave modes and resonances which can exist within a plasma. He followed this with a detailed discussion of auroral hiss highlighting the different structures of auroral hiss, the physical mechanism driving auroral hiss, and why the amplitude of auroral hiss is larger when observed in-situ as opposed to observed on the ground. Jim then moved onto auroral cyclotron harmonic (ACH) emissions which are observed at 2 to 5 times fce, a result of the changing magnetic field strength and ionospheric electron density as a function of altitude. Follow ACH waves Jim discussed Auroral medium frequency bursts, short lived but frequency structured emissions observed around substorm onset. Jim finished his discussion with an overview of Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR), the strongest of auroral emissions. Jim highlighted several seminal investigations of AKR from FAST, Geotail, and Cluster studying the electron distribution function in AKR, the altitude profile of AKR emissions, and the propagation of ARK emissions. In his final slide Jim provided a neat summary matric of the different types of Auroral emissions and highlighted how new technology, increasingly fast (and cheap) computers, and the increasing size of data disks will allow for advancements in the analysis of auroral emissions.
