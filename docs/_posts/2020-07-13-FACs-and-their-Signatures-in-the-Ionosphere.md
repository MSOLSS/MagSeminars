Dr. Hermann LÃ¼ehr gave a thorough overview of the field aligned currents responsible for coupling the magnetosphere and ionosphere. Hermann started his talk with a brief history of field aligned currents and the initial observations of these current structures by in-situ satellites presented by Tom Potemera at the 1975 Fall AGU and the subsequent ground-breaking paper [Iijima and Potemera (1976)][1]. He followed this with a discussion of the mapping of field aligned currents between the magnetosphere and ionosphere, their drivers, ionospheric patterns under varying solar wind conditions, and scale sizes. Hermann then went on to provide a detailed discussion of the measurement techniques used to quantify field aligned currents for single point and multi-point (2 and 4 point, and multi track e.g. AMPERE) observations of the magnetic field, and the assumptions inherent to each technique (see also [Ionospheric Multi-Spacecraft Analysis Tools][2]). Hermann concluded with a discussion of storm and substorm field aligned currents and the importance of small-scale field aligned currents (especially for atmospheric dynamics).
