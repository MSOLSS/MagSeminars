Eric Grimes, software developer at UCLA, gave a wonderful overview of [pySPEDAS][1] 1.0 the Python implementation of the [Space Physics Environment Data Analysis Software (SPEDAS)][2] originally developed in [IDL][3]. pySPEDAS runs in Python >3.5 and Eric suggests the simplest way to use pySPEDAS is with [Anaconda][4] within  a [Virtual Environment][5]; a standalone or seperate instance of Python which helps keeps package dependencies in order. Virtual environments are particular helpful when working on projects which may need different versions of Python (e.g., 2.7, 3.5), or projects that rely on specific module/package versions. You can read more on Virtual Environments at [freeCodeCamp][6] and [Real Python][7].

In his tutorial Eric covered the basics of of pySPEDAS including installation, managing the local data directories (where data is downloaded), and importing pySPEDAS into Python. He then presented a number of examples to load various data sets, plot 1D and 2D data loaded into ```tplot``` variables using [pyTPLOT][8], as well as accessing ```tplot``` variables for further investigation/analysis and creating your own ```tplot``` variables. Eric finished the tutorial with a brief overview of plotting options and how they can be changed/accessed (e.g., line colors and axis titles) and how to access documentation on various functions, routines, and modules using the Python ```help``` function.

If you're interested in contributing to pySPEDAS, find a bug, or would like to suggest a new utility, function, or dataset you can contact Eric by email, submitt an issue on GitHub, or fork the repository and submitt a pull request with your changes. 

You can find a recording of Eric's seminar on our [YouTube channel][8] and a copy of his talk [here][9].
