Dr. Joe Borovsky kicked off the Magnetosphere Online Seminar Series with his talk "The Magnetosphere as a System". In his talk Joe presented an overview of the complex solar wind-magnetosphere interaction, the various plasma regimes which comprise Earth's magnetosphere, and the physical processes which couple these regimes within the system. A more thorough review can be found in the paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10712-018-9487-x">The Earth's Magnetosphere: A Systems Science Overview and Assessment [Borovksy and Valdivia 2018]</a> as well as a number of resources recommended by Joe at the end of this post.

The seminar recieved overwhelming attendence, reaching max capacity within a few minutes of starting, and had a very active question and answer period. While reaching capacity of the meeting is a huge positive, this unfourtunately meant that not everyone was able to attend the seminar. For those unable to attend the seminar live you can view a recording of the seminar on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNlOK9mCmI3V111EHQRCuEQ">YouTube channel</a>.
