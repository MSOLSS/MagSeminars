In this weekâ€™s seminar Dr. Eric Donavan from the University of Calgary gave a comprehensive overview of the proton aurora. Eric began with the history of proton auroral observations and the Doppler shifted H-beta and H-alpha emissions. He went on to describe the proton aurora, a relatively dim unstructured auroral emission as compared to other auroral phenomena, and discussed various observations of the proton aurora including meridian scanning photometers, global imagers, and low altitude spacecraft. Eric continued with an overview of the isotropy boundary and its relation to proton precipitation, filling of the loss cone, and the proton aurora. Eric finished with a discussion of the proton aurora and it's relation to the night-side magnetic field topology and geomagnetic activity. In his final slide Eric provided a great summary of his presentation, key results, and the utility of the proton aurora in space physics and future missions.
