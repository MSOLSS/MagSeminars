Dr. Clare Watt continued the Magnetosphere Online Seminar Series with an excellent overview of Auroral Acceleration Mechanisms and how they relate to the Magnetospheric Substorm. Dr. Watt started with the fundamentals of the aurora including the generation of the aurora in the upper atmosphere, the different colors of the aurora, and how the color of aurora is related to the energy of precipitating electrons and the height at which the auroral emission occurs. She continued with a detailed description of the different types of aurora, auroral morphologies and discrete vs diffuse aurora; this included auroral arcs, polar cap aurora, patch aurora, pulsating and flickering aurora, and substorm aurora. Clare continued with a description of auroral acceleration mechanisms, focusing in detail on discrete aurora driven by quasi-static potential drops (or inverted V aurora) and diffuse aurora driven by broadband/dispersive Alfven waves (Alfvenic aurora). In her overview of inverted V and Alfvenic aurora, Clare described the electric fields which drive electron acceleration for both mechanisms, how each mechanism is manifested (or can be identified) in electron distribution functions and pitch angle profiles, and the occurrence of each auroral acceleration mechanism. Clare finished her talk with a discussion of auroral acceleration during magnetospheric substorms highlighting the link between electromagnetic waves observed in the ionosphere and magnetosphere with auroral dynamics and the development of discrete spatial and temporal wave features in the aurora during the onset of substorms. In her conclusions Clare detailed open questions in auroral physics emphasizing the need for multi-point observations and kinetic modelling to address these questions.
