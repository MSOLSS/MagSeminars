Dr. Takuma Nakamura surveyed the properties of the Earthâ€™s Low Latitude Boundary Layer (LLBL) and its proposed generation mechanisms.  He emphasized its multilayer structure, dependence upon the IMF orientation, and temperature anisotropies.  He then considered the roles of reconnection, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, kinetic Alfven waves, and cross-scale, cross-processes in forming the LLBL. Takuma also provided a wonderful list of the papers he referenced through out his presentation.
