Dr. Stephen Fuselier gave a great overview of Oxygen in the Earth's magnetosphere. Stephen disussed the inital discovery of Oxygen in the magnetosphere and then went on to give a thorough overview of the source, various populations, trasport and convection, and sinks of Oxygen within the Earth's Magnetosphere. Stephen finished with a discussion of open questions and future work.
