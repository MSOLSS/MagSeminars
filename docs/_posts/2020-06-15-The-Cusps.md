Dr. Benoit Lavraud presented a comprehensive review of the Earthâ€™s cusps.  He began with  a brief history of their discovery, then showed that Dungey models for reconnection under northward and southward IMF orientations predict their low-, mid-, and high-altitude characteristics very well. He concluded with a discussion of the remaining open questions, and noted the synergy of the forthcoming ESA/CAS SMILE and NASA TRACERS missions that may be able to answer these questions.
