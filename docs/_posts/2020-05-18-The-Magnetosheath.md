Dr. Ferdinand Plaschke gave a wonderful seminar on the Earth's magnetosheath. Ferdinand discussed the global structure of the magnetosheath, including the magnetic field and plasma topology, as well as local processes within the sheath such as mirror modes, whistler wave and "lion roars", turbulence, ion cyclotron waves, reconnection and flux transfer events. He also covered external transients such as IMF and pressure variations, CME magnetic clouds and SW magnetic holes, hot flow anomolies and foreshock bubbles, and high-speed jets.

You can find a copy of Ferdinands's [talk here][1] as well as a recording of his seminar on our [YouTube channel][2]
