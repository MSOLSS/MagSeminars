In this weekâ€™s seminar Dr. Sarah Vines staff scientist at JHU APL discussed Multi-point Observations in magnetospheric physics. In her seminar Sarah highlighted two _types_ of multi-point observations. The first, multi-mission or distributed multi-point observations which allow scientists to characterize macro and global scale phenomena. This includes missions such as THEMIS, distributed ground-based arrays (including all-sky cameras, magnetometers, and radars), and conjunction between multiple missions. Sarah highlighted several studies using distributed multi-point observations including THEMIS's seminal study which used the relative timing of ionospheric and tail processes to diagnose the sequence of events leading to substorm onset. She further highlighted studies using multiple missions and space assets (GOES, LANL) to characterize the global dynamics of energetic particles in the magnetosphere and to diagnose and track magnetospheric instabilities leading to the generation of electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves. Sarah finished her discussion of distributed multi-point observations highlighting the utility of ground-based observations and in particular ground-based magnetometers and the cross-phase technique to image the magnetospheric plasma densities during a geomagnetic storm. She then went on to discuss constellation missions and their utility in characterizing both micro-scale (e.g., MMS), macro-scale (e.g., Cluster) and global (e.g., AMPERE) phenomena. Sarah discussed the various multi-point analysis techniques utilized by constellation missions including timing and phase analysis, quantifying spatial gradients - highlighting the Coulometer technique - and using multi-point observations for event reconstruction. Sarah finished her seminar with a brief discussion of the importance of multi-point observations and constellation missions in Heliophysics and highlighted the importance of making multi-point analysis tools (including instrument calibration) and documentation readily accessible to entire Heliophysics community.
