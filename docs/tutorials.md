Tutorials are held once every month in collabroation with the Center For Helioanalytics. You can view the tutorial material at the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HelioAnalytics/MOSS_python).

Initally the tutorials will provide an introductions to Python and will expand to Heliophysics and Spacephysics packages within Python and other languages. 

We will be using [Juptyer Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) as much as possible. Using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) means that accessing the tutorials doesn't require you to install Python; however, having Python will prove useful if you plan to transition to it for you analysis and work. 

The web is full of Python resources (which can be intimadating if your just starting out). Below we have compiled a set of usefull links to getting started with Python. 

<h2>Anaconda</h2>

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is an open-source distribution for python. It is widely used as a fascilitator for science as it provides access to Python via the [Anacond Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/) and [Anacond Prompt](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#starting-conda).
