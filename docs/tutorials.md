Tutorials are held once every month in collaboration with the Center For Helioanalytics. You can view the tutorial material at the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HelioAnalytics/MOSS_python).

Initially the tutorials will provide an introductions to Python and will expand to Heliophysics and Spacephysics packages within Python and other languages. 

We will be using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) as much as possible. Using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) means that accessing the tutorials doesn't require you to install Python; however, having Python will prove useful if you plan to transition to it for you analysis and work. 

<h2>Resources</h2>

The web is full of Python resources (which can be intimidating if you're just starting out). Below we have compiled a set of useful links to getting started with Python. 

<h3>Anaconda</h3>

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is an open-source distribution for python. It is widely used as a fascilitator for science as it provides access to Python, Python Packages, and several Python IDEs ([Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)) via the [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/) and [Anaconda Prompt](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#starting-conda).
