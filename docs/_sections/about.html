  The Magnetosphere Online Seminar Series is a weekly seminar held
  every Monday at 1200 EDST (1600 UT). The Seminar Series will begin with
  overview talks <i>marching</i> through the magnetosphere, interspersed
  with software, mission, and instrument tutorials. Following these, the 
  Seminar Series will transition to invited and contributed science talks
  and tutorials.
