# Magnetosphere Online Seminar Series

The Magnetosphere Online Seminar Series is held every Monday at noon. 

The [website](https://msolss.github.io/MagSeminars/) has information on schedule, contacting us, and joining the meeting.

The website is a "blog" type website: [Jekyll-theme-prologue Demo](https://chrisbobbe.github.io/jekyll-theme-prologue/). 

Blog posts are held for individual speakers and can be added by creating a Marddown file (.md) in the _posts folder following the naming format YYYY-MM-DD-Title-of-post.md. These posts will be automatically added to the website.

More complicated posts (adding images, headings, etc.) can be made using html, examples can be seen on the demo site or in examples/2018-01-12-elements.html.
